# 安装

## Linux:
1. Download Linux wrapper script (Right click, Save Link As apktool)
2. Download apktool-2 (find newest here)
3. Make sure you have the 32bit libraries (ia32-libs) downloaded and installed by your linux package manager, if you are on a 64bit unix system.
4. (This helps provide support for the 32bit native binary aapt, which is required by apktool)
5. Rename downloaded jar to apktool.jar
6. Move both files (apktool.jar & apktool) to /usr/local/bin (root needed)
7. Make sure both files are executable (chmod +x)
8. Try running apktool via cli
